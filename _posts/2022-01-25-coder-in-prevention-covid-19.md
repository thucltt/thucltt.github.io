First, this is the first blog I'm writing using English sorry for my poor English!

Today, my team has received the certificate of the AICovidVN contest (some information of contest is here: [https://aihub.vn/competitions/22](https://aihub.vn/competitions/22)).

And I decide to write a brief something about my thinking!

The contest ended about half a year ago. At this time, the number of people infected with Covid-19 increases at a rapid rate. The contest was held with the purpose research an infection-detected method to prevent infection. As a participant, I'm so proud that I contributed to prevention Covid. Although, my team's solution is not the best, but I think my team made a motivation to promoted all participant research the best solution. I hope Viet Nam and The World will return to normal as soon as possible.
