The last March, I was so happy when the opportunity to talk with students at the [Nguyen Tat Thanh Institute of International Education (NIIE)](http://niie.edu.vn/gioi-thieu/) on the topic ["The Importance of Data structure and Algorithms in Computer programming"](http://niie.edu.vn/sv-cong-nghe-thong-tin-gap-go-chuyen-gia-trong-4-buoi-workshop-ve-du-lieu-bao-mat-code/). Thanks to [Mr. Khiet Luong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khiet-luong-33429410b/) for inviting me.

With my experiences, I hope students are aware of "The Importance" of Data structure and Algorithms and apply this knowledge in their projects. I also share something about method learning data structure and algorithms I learned from my learning process, hope it can help students during learning.

Hope to have the opportunity to talk about other interesting topics with students.
